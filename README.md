Pico8 Bike Game

Made using the Pico 8 fantasy "console". Just for fun :)

You can play it in the pico 8 console or your browser. To play in your browser, download the bike.html and bike.js files, place them in the same directory, and open bike.html in a modern browser, and it should run just fine.
